# Computational Physics and Machine Learning: Project 3

This repository contains scripts to explore Gaussian Process Regression. This repository was setup for project 3 of the lecture Computational Physics and Machine Learning.

## More information:
The main file to run the scripts is `run_gpr.py` and the jupyter notebooks explain how to find the best GPR for the given data. The output from different runs can be found this [here](output).

## How to setup
1. Create conda environment
```python
conda create --name compsci_project_3 --file requirements.txt
```
2. Run one of the following lines depending on your use case.
```python
# if you only want to run the code
python setup.py install
# if you want to change some scripts later
python setup.py develop
```
